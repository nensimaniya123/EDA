# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Titanic Dataset

## 🧠 Objective
To explore and understand the Titanic dataset using summary statistics and data visualizations.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Plotly 

## 📈 What I Did
1. Loaded and examined the dataset (nulls, types, statistics).
2. Created histograms and boxplots for numeric features like Age and Fare.
3. Built a correlation matrix and pairplots to analyze feature relationships.
4. Investigated trends like survival by gender and class.
5. Compiled a professional PDF report summarizing insights.

## 📎 Files Included
- `EDA.ipynb`: Notebook with full EDA code and visuals.
- `Titanic-Dataset.csv`: The dataset.
- `EDA_Report_Titanic.pdf`: A clean report summarizing the analysis.

## ✅ Result
Found clear patterns:
- Women and children had higher survival rates.
- 1st class passengers had better chances.
- Fare and Pclass are correlated.
